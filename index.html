               <p class="paraspace"> Hi, I'm Anoushka. I'm currently a third year student at the University of Toronto. 
                   I'm pursuing a double major in Criminology and Computer Science. 
                   I am passionate towards creating and designing projects that could help people. I aspire towards a career that could allow me to utilize my creativity on projects that could improve on everyday life.
                   I love to try new things whenever the opportunity is given and I'm open to collaborate with new people. On my spare time, I enjoy painting, embroidery and watching movies, as well as spending quality time with friends and family. </p>
